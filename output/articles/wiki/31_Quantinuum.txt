Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. The company's H-Series trapped-ion quantum computers set the highest quantum volume to date of 33,554,432 in September 2025. This architecture supports all-to-all qubit connectivity, allowing entangled states to be created between all qubits, and enables a high fidelity of quantum states.
Quantinuum has developed middleware and software products that run on trapped-ion and other quantum computing platforms for cybersecurity, quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, quantum Monte Carlo integration, and quantum artificial intelligence. The company also offers quantum-computing-hardened encryption keys designed to protect data assets and enhance cryptographic defenses.
