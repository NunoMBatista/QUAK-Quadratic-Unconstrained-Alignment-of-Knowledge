Silicon Quantum Computing Pty Ltd (SQC) is a Sydney, Australia-based quantum computing company.
The company develops quantum computers and analogue quantum devices using phosphorus atoms manufactured within silicon using scanning tunnelling microscopes, an approach within the field of spin qubits.
Distinct from other companies within the spin qubits modality, SQC uses the nuclear spin of phosphorus atoms placed within isotopically pure Si-28 wafers for quantum computation. Atoms used as qubits have demonstrated favourable performance indicators such as long coherence times and biased noise.
