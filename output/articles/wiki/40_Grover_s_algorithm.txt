In quantum computing, Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          
            N
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {N}})}
  
 evaluations of the function, where 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  
 is the size of the function's domain. It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996.
The analogous problem in classical computation would have a query complexity 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        N
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(N)}
  
 (i.e., the function would have to be evaluated 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        N
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(N)}
  
 times: there is no better approach than trying out all input values one after the other, which, on average, takes 
  
    
      
        N
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle N/2}
  
 steps).
Charles H. Bennett, Ethan Bernstein, Gilles Brassard, and Umesh Vazirani proved that any quantum solution to the problem needs to evaluate the function 
  
    
      
        Ω
        (
        
          
            N
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega ({\sqrt {N}})}
  
 times, so Grover's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Since classical algorithms for NP-complete problems require exponentially many steps, and Grover's algorithm provides at most a quadratic speedup over the classical solution for unstructured search, this suggests that Grover's algorithm by itself will not provide polynomial-time solutions for NP-complete problems (as the square root of an exponential function is still an exponential, not a polynomial function).
Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup. However, even quadratic speedup is considerable when 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  
 is large, and Grover's algorithm can be applied to speed up broad classes of algorithms. Grover's algorithm could brute-force a 128-bit symmetric cryptographic key in roughly 264 iterations, or a 256-bit key in roughly 2128 iterations. It may not be the case that Grover's algorithm poses a significantly increased risk to encryption over existing classical algorithms, however.
