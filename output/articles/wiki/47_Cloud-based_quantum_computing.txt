Cloud-based quantum computing refers to the remote access of quantum computing resources—such as quantum emulators, simulators, or processors—via the internet. Cloud access enables users to develop, test, and execute quantum algorithms without the need for direct interaction with specialized hardware, facilitating broader participation in quantum software development and experimentation.
In 2016, IBM launched the IBM Quantum Experience, one of the first publicly accessible quantum processors connected to the cloud. In early 2017, researchers at Rigetti Computing demonstrated programmable quantum cloud access through their software platform Forest, which included the pyQuil Python library.
Since the early-2020s, cloud-based quantum computing has grown significantly, with multiple providers offering access to a variety of quantum hardware modalities, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and photonic systems. Major platforms such as  Amazon Braket, Azure Quantum, and qBraid aggregate quantum devices from hardware developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, QuEra, Pasqal, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and IBM Quantum. These platforms provide unified interfaces for users to write and execute quantum algorithms across diverse backends, often supporting open-source SDKs such as Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. The proliferation of cloud-based access has played a key role in accelerating quantum education, algorithm research, and early-stage application development by lowering the barrier to experimentation with real quantum hardware.
Cloud-based quantum computing has expanded access to quantum hardware and tools beyond traditional research laboratories. These platforms support educational initiatives, algorithm development, and early-stage commercial applications.
