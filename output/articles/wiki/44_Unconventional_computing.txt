Unconventional computing (also known as alternative computing or nonstandard computation) is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. 
The term unconventional computation was coined by Cristian S. Calude and John Casti and used at the First International Conference on Unconventional Models of Computation in 1998.
