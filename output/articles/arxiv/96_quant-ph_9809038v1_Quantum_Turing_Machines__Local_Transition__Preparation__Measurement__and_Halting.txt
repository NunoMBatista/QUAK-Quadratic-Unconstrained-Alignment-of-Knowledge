Title: Quantum Turing Machines: Local Transition, Preparation, Measurement, and Halting
Query: Quantum Computing
---
Foundations of the theory of quantum Turing machines are investigated. The protocol for the preparation and the measurement of quantum Turing machines is discussed. The local transition functions are characterized for fully general quantum Turing machines. A new halting protocol is proposed without augmenting the halting qubit and is shown to work without spoiling the computation.
