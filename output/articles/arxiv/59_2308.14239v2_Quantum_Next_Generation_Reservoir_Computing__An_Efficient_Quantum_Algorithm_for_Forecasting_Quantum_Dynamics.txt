Title: Quantum Next Generation Reservoir Computing: An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Forecasting Quantum Dynamics
Query: Quantum Computing
---
Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) is a modern class of model-free machine learning that enables an accurate forecasting of time series data generated by dynamical systems. We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately predict full many-body quantum dynamics in both integrable and chaotic systems. This is in contrast to the conventional application of reservoir computing that concentrates on the prediction of the dynamics of observables. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique. This proposal presents an efficient model-free quantum scheme to forecast quantum dynamics coherently, bypassing inductive biases incurred in a model-based approach.
