Title: Quantum computing at the quantum advantage threshold: a down-to-business review
Query: Quantum Computing
---
It is expected that quantum computers would enable solving various problems that are beyond the capabilities of the most powerful current supercomputers, which are based on classical technologies. In the last three decades, advances in quantum computing stimulated significant interest in this field from industry, investors, media, executives, and general public. However, the understanding of this technology, its current capabilities and its potential impact in these communities is still lacking. Closing this gap requires a complete picture of how to assess quantum computing devices' performance and estimate their potential, a task made harder by the variety of quantum computing models and physical platforms. Here we review the state of the art in quantum computing, promising computational models and the most developed physical platforms. We also discuss potential applications, the requirements posed by these applications and technological pathways towards addressing these requirements. Finally, we summarize and analyze the arguments for the quantum computing market's further exponential growth. The review is written in a simple language without equations, and should be accessible to readers with no advanced background in mathematics and physics.
