Title: A model of quantum spacetime
Query: Quantum Computing
---
We consider a global quantum system (the "Universe") satisfying a double constraint, both on total energy and total momentum. Generalizing the Page and Wootters quantum clock formalism, we provide a model of 3+1 dimensional, non-relativistic, quantum spacetime emerging from entanglement among different subsystems in a globally "timeless" and "positionless" Universe.
