Title: Hidden variable model for quantum computation with magic states on qudits of any dimension
Query: Quantum Computing
---
It was recently shown that a hidden variable model can be constructed for universal quantum computation with magic states on qubits. Here we show that this result can be extended, and a hidden variable model can be defined for quantum computation with magic states on qudits with any Hilbert space dimension. This model leads to a classical simulation algorithm for universal quantum computation.
