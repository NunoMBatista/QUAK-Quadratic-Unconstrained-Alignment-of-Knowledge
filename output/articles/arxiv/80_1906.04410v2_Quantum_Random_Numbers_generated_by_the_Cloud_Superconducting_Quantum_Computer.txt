Title: Quantum Random Numbers generated by the Cloud Superconducting Quantum Computer
Query: Quantum Computing
---
A cloud quantum computer is similar to a random number generator in that its physical mechanism is inaccessible to its users. In this respect, a cloud quantum computer is a black box. In both devices, its users decide the device condition from the output. A framework to achieve this exists in the field of random number generation in the form of statistical tests for random number generators. In the present study, we generated random numbers on a 20-qubit cloud quantum computer and evaluated the condition and stability of its qubits using statistical tests for random number generators. As a result, we observed that some qubits were more biased than others. Statistical tests for random number generators may provide a simple indicator of qubit condition and stability, enabling users to decide for themselves which qubits inside a cloud quantum computer to use.
