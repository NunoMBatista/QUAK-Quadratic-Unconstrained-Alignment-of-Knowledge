Title: Hybrid Meta-Solving for Practical Quantum Computing
Query: Quantum Computing
---
The advent of quantum algorithms has initiated a discourse on the potential for quantum speedups for optimization problems. However, several factors still hinder a practical realization of the potential benefits. These include the lack of advanced, error-free quantum hardware, the absence of accessible software stacks for seamless integration and interaction, and the lack of methods that allow us to leverage the theoretical advantages to real-world use cases. This paper works towards the creation of an accessible hybrid software stack for solving optimization problems, aiming to create a fundamental platform that can utilize quantum technologies to enhance the solving process. We introduce a novel approach that we call Hybrid Meta-Solving, which combines classical and quantum optimization techniques to create customizable and extensible hybrid solvers. We decompose mathematical problems into multiple sub-problems that can be solved by classical or quantum solvers, and propose techniques to semi-automatically build the best solver for a given problem. Implemented in our ProvideQ toolbox prototype, Meta-Solving provides interactive workflows for accessing quantum computing capabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates the applicability of Meta-Solving in industrial use cases. It shows that we can reuse state-of-the-art classical algorithms and extend them with quantum computing techniques. Our approach is designed to be at least as efficient as state-of-the-art classical techniques, while having the potential to outperform them if future advances in the quantum domain are made.
