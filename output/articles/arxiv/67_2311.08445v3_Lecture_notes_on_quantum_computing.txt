Title: Lecture notes on quantum computing
Query: Quantum Computing
---
These are the lecture notes of the master's course "Quantum Computing", taught at Chalmers University of Technology every fall since 2020, with participation of students from RWTH Aachen and Delft University of Technology. The aim of this course is to provide a theoretical overview of quantum computing, excluding specific hardware implementations. Topics covered in these notes include quantum algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm), variational quantum algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers [such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA), among others], quantum error correction, various versions of quantum computing (such as measurement-based quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and the continuous-variable approach to quantum information), the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, and quantum complexity theory. Lectures on these topics are compiled into 12 chapters, most of which contain a few suggested exercises at the end, and interspersed with four tutorials, which provide practical exercises as well as further details. At Chalmers, the course is taught in seven weeks, with three two-hour lectures or tutorials per week. It is recommended that the students taking the course have some previous experience with quantum physics, but not strictly necessary.
