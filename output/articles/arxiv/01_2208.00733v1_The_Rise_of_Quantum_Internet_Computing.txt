Title: The Rise of Quantum Internet Computing
Query: Quantum Computing
---
This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to (classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over the (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum information for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum applications, over Internet-scale distances.
