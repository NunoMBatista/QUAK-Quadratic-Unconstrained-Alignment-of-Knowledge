Title: Holomorphic representation of quantum computations
Query: Quantum Computing
---
We study bosonic quantum computations using the Segal-Bargmann representation of quantum states. We argue that this holomorphic representation is a natural one which not only gives a canonical description of bosonic quantum computing using basic elements of complex analysis but also provides a unifying picture which delineates the boundary between discrete- and continuous-variable quantum information theory. Using this representation, we show that the evolution of a single bosonic mode under a Gaussian Hamiltonian can be described as an integrable dynamical system of classical Calogero-Moser particles corresponding to the zeros of the holomorphic function, together with a conformal evolution of Gaussian parameters. We explain that the Calogero-Moser dynamics is due to unique features of bosonic Hilbert spaces such as squeezing. We then generalize the properties of this holomorphic representation to the multimode case, deriving a non-Gaussian hierarchy of quantum states and relating entanglement to factorization properties of holomorphic functions. Finally, we apply this formalism to discrete- and continuous- variable quantum measurements and obtain a classification of subuniversal models that are generalizations of Boson Sampling and Gaussian quantum computing.
