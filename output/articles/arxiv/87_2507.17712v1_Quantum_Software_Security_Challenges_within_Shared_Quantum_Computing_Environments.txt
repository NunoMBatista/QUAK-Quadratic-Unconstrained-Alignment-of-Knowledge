Title: Quantum Software Security Challenges within Shared Quantum Computing Environments
Query: Quantum Computing
---
The number of qubits in quantum computers keeps growing, but most quantum programs remain relatively small because of the noisy nature of the underlying quantum hardware. This might lead quantum cloud providers to explore increased hardware utilization, and thus profitability through means such as multi-programming, which would allow the execution of multiple programs in parallel. The adoption of such technology would bring entirely new challenges to the field of quantum software security. This article explores and reports the key challenges identified in quantum software security within shared quantum computing environments.
